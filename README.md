## 🔌 Wiring Connections

| IR Sensor Pin | Arduino |
|---------------|----------|
| VCC           | 5V       |
| GND           | GND      |
| OUT           | Digital Pin 2 |

## ⚙ Working Principle

- IR sensor emits infrared light.
- When object is near, IR reflects back.
- Sensor module outputs digital signal.
- Arduino reads HIGH/LOW to detect obstacle.
